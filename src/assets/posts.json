As the number of purchases increase, the price decreases until it reaches a minimum and stays constant. The X-axis shows the number of purchases and the Y-axis displays the price. The line starts at a higher point on the Y-axis, representing the initial higher price, and gradually slopes downward until it reaches the minimum price and levels off. This graph displays the relationship between the number of purchases and the price of the product, and how the price reaches a point where it no longer changes.",
