There are many different standards such as fungible (where one unit is equal to another, like money) and non-fungible (where one unit is not equal to another, like artwork). These standards tell you what your contract needs to implement in order to be considered compliant with the standard. You can have functions that are not included or go above and beyond the standards, however, you must ensure that if you can only communicate with your contract through the standard’s functions that you can still access the functionality.

The tokens are, therefore, “lost”. There is also no way for a contract to revert when it receives ERC20 tokens because there is no way for it to know when it receives those tokens."],
